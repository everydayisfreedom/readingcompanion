      "body": "French is the second most-widely taught language after English, with most of the worldâ€™s French speaking population residing in Africa. \n\nIt is the fastest growing language on the African continent in terms of official and foreign language. \n\nHowever, literacy in African countries roughly averages 70%. \n\nIncreasing literacy skills demands practice and exposure to reading material. Reading helps expand vocabulary and shows the reader correct use of idioms and clauses.  A study has also shown that reading strengthens brain connectivity. Furthermore, reading researchers found that regular readers, starting at a young age, gradually develop large vocabularies. \n\nVocabulary size and language fluency can impact many areas of life, from standardized scores to admissions in jobs and colleges."

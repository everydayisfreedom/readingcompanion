The purpose of this system would be to allow users to begin with the reading of a specific text, then to choose or get a recommendation based on their preferred aspect
(themes, genreâ€¦) or based on the areas that they would want to improve such as vocabulary, grammar, and structure.

Due to the ample free-to-use and open-source language and development tools available online, the project was feasible in terms of technological resources.

For anything related to the Web Application, I have used:

- HTML 5.

- CSS.

- React JS.

- JavaScript.

- JSON files.

- Visual Code Studio.


For the text treatment and analysis, I used:

- Jupyter notebook.

- Python.

- Excel.

- Google sheets.

- SpaCy and its French model.

- VADER.

- NLTK.
